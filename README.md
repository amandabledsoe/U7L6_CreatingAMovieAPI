This my solution for Unit 7: Lab 6 "Creating a Movie API" in the 2022 C# .NET After-Hours Boot Camp at Grand Circus.

# CREATING A MOVIE API
### Objective: 
Producing an API

### Task: 
Create a Web API that will provide movie data.

### What will the application do?
Design an API that will provide the following endpoints:

### Get a list of all movies
- Get a list of all movies in a specific category
- User specifies category as a query parameter
- Get a random movie pick
- Get a random movie pick from a specific category
- User specifies category as a query parameter
- Get a list of random movie picks
- User specifies quantity as a query parameter
- Get a list of all movie categories
- Get info about a specific movie
- User specifies title as a query parameter
- Get a list of movies which have a keyword in their title
- User specifies title as a query parameter

### Build Specifications:
- Create a small movie database in SQL. Create a Moive table based upon the tasks above. 
- Complete the first 4 tasks above, then complete as many as you can tasks 5-8, starting with whatever you want as extended challenges.
- API queries which return no results should return properly formatted empty JSON (for instance, a search for a category that doesnâ€™t exist).
- You can use Postman to test your API.

### Grading Standards:
- 2 points for a working API project
- 2 points each for items 1-4 above
- 1pt 5-8 are extended exercise
